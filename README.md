Hey, welcome to my frontend project!

In this project I took the following API (https://restcountries.com/) and made a simple dashboard from it.

In this project, you can see some:
[x]: frontend filtering
[x]: A search field to seach through 250 countries
[x]: A sorting feature, to sort countries based on certain criteria
[x]: A dark and light mode
[x]: Add your countries to your travel wishlist

Here is the tech stack that I used:

- TypeScript
- Redux
- MUI
- React

and more!
